# unraid-monitoring-operator

Simple project to help deploying monitoring _stuff_ in UnRaid.

In the real world we usually have big-and-heavy k8s _stuff_ automatically deploying monitoring _stuff_.
The goal of this project is to make it possible also in the UnRaid world (or any other world that is using
docker containers instead of the whole k8s stack.)
